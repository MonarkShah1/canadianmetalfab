3. **Case studies / “Jobs we’ve saved”** – visual before-after speed or cost wins

### 3. 2025 SEO Must-Haves

| Pillar | Why It Matters | Key Techniques |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Keyword focus** | Google’s Helpful Content update rewards intent-driven, niche terms. | Target long-tails like “custom stainless steel welding food-grade”. |
| **Technical SEO** | Crawlability & structured data → faster ranking. | Static pre-render (Next.js), sitemap, robots.txt, Schema.org (`Organization`, `Service`, `FAQ`, `BreadcrumbList`). |
| **E-A-T signals** | Trust markers are huge in B2B. | Author bios (P.Eng.), ISO certificates, testimonial quotes, review schema. |
| **Core Web Vitals** | Humans still bounce on slow sites. | Perf budget < 150 kB JS, optimized images, edge caching. |
| **Local SEO** | Many RFQs start with “near me”. | GMB profile, `LocalBusiness` schema, NAP in footer. |

### 4. Design & UX Principles

* Above-the-fold clarity – one-sentence value prop + CTA  
* Scannable service cards – icon + headline + 50-word blurb  
* Evidence banners – “10-day average turnaround”, “99.7 % on-time delivery”  
* Industrial palette – **CMF Blue #003B73** + warm accent (safety-orange) for CTAs  
* Gated deep-dives – e-mail-for-PDF design guides  
* Conversion friction ≤ 2 clicks (RFQ in ~20 s)
